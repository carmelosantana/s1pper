Enhance your 3D printing experience on the Ender 3 S1 Pro with s1pper macros. These custom macros replace the default Creality and Cura macros, bringing in a dynamic purge line near the mesh area for a smarter, cleaner start to every print.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get s1pper macros running on your setup:

### Cura Slicer Script Setup

**Install Script:**

1. Download the `KlipperPrintArea.py` file from this repository.
2. Move `KlipperPrintArea.py` to your Cura Slicer scripts folder.

**Update Printer Settings in Cura:**

1. Replace the existing Start G-Code with the following:

```G-Code
S__PRINTER_START EXTRUDER_TEMP={material_print_temperature_layer_0} BED_TEMP={material_bed_temperature_layer_0} AREA_START=%MINX%,%MINY% AREA_END=%MAXX%,%MAXY%
```

2. Replace the existing End G-Code with the following:

```G-Code
S__PRINTER_END
```

### Printer Configuration

1. On your printer's system, create two new files as follows:
   - `s1pper.cfg`
   - `s1pper-automesh.cfg`
2. Copy and paste the respective contents from this repository into the newly created files on your printer.
3. Open `printer.cfg` on your printer.
4. Add the following line to the top of the file:

```G-Code
[include s1pper.cfg]
```

## Macros

### `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE`

Adapts the original automesh script by ChipCE to accommodate a dynamic purge line near the mesh area, scaling with print size. This macro calculates mesh points based on the print area and ensures an optimized bed mesh calibration for each print.

### `BED_MESH_PURGE_LINE`

Prints a custom purge line near the mesh area to ensure a clean start for every print. This macro dynamically calculates the extrusion length and travel distance based on the print area, aiming to extrude between 5-15mm of filament per pass.

### `S__PRINTER_PREHEAT`

Preheats the printer to the specified or default temperatures - 60Â°C for the bed and 190Â°C for the extruder, ensuring readiness for the printing process.

### `S__PURGE_RESET_POSITION`

Resets the extruder position to 0 and elevates the Z-axis to 2.0mm at 3000mm/min, preparing the printer for subsequent operations.

### `S__START_POSITION`

Transitions the printer head to coordinates (X=5, Y=20, Z=0.3) at 5000mm/min, establishing the start position for the purge line.

### `S__PRINTER_START`

A comprehensive start macro that configures the printer for absolute positioning, resets the extruder, homes all axes, preheats the printer, triggers bed mesh calibration within the specified print area, and resets position post-purge.

### `S__PRINTER_END`

A consolidated end macro, amalgamating actions from Creality and Cura with custom tweaks, to gracefully conclude the print job by turning off essential components and repositioning the print head.
